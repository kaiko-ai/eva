# Contributing to EVA

EVA is open source and community contributions are welcome!

## Contribution Process

### GitHub Issues

The EVA contribution process generally starts with filing a
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/kaiko-ai/eva/issues).

EVA defines four categories of issues: feature requests, bug reports,
documentation fixes, and installation issues. In general, we recommend
waiting for feedback from a EVA maintainer or community member before
proceeding to implement a feature or patch.

### Pull Requests

After you have agreed upon an implementation strategy for your feature or patch
with an EVA maintainer, the next step is to introduce your changes as a pull request
against the EVA repository.

Steps to make a pull request:

-   Fork https://github.com/kaiko-ai/eva
-   Implement your feature as a branch off of the `main` branch
-   Create a pull request into the `main` branch of https://github.com/kaiko-ai/eva

Once your pull request has been merged, your changes will be automatically
included in the next EVA release!
