Observational study comparing the total rates of admissions and of occupied bed days in general hospitals between populations with and without access to GP hospitals. Comparisons were also made separately for diagnoses commonly encountered in GP hospitals. Two general hospitals serving the population of Finnmark county in north Norway. 35,435 admissions based on five years' routine recordings from the two hospitals. The total rate of admission to general hospitals was lower in peripheral municipalities with a GP hospital than in central municipalities without this kind of institution, 26% and 28% lower for men and women respectively. The corresponding differences were 38% and 52%, when analysed for occupied bed days. The differences were most pronounced for patients with respiratory diseases, cardiac failure, and cancer who are primarily or intermediately treated or cared for in GP hospitals, and for patients with stroke and fractures, who are regularly transferred from general hospitals to GP hospitals for longer term follow up care.\\nInstruction: Carefully read the question and the provided context.

Subjects (N = 247) were outpatients who participated in either the National Institute of Mental Health-funded Phenomenology and Course of Pediatric Bipolar Disorders study or the Treatment of Early Age Mania (TEAM) study. Both studies required that subjects have current DSM-IV bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed phase) and a Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) score<or=60. All subjects had elation and\/or grandiosity. Subjects in the Phenomenology study were obtained from 1995 to 1998 by consecutive new case ascertainment from designated pediatric and psychiatric facilities. Subjects in the TEAM RCT were recruited from media and community sources between March 2003 and March 2005. Assessment instruments included the Washington University in St. Louis Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, given separately to parents about their children and to children about themselves, and the CGAS. Logistic regression was used for comparisons. The TEAM and Phenomenology groups were similar in age (10.4 [SD = 2.3], 10.9 [SD = 2.3]years, respectively) and other demography. Both had long current episode duration (4.8 [SD = 2.4], 3.2 [SD = 2.3]years) and low lifetime use of any mood stabilizer (23.6%, 35.0%). Many mania symptoms and ultradian rapid cycling, psychosis, and suicidality were significantly more prevalent in the RCT sample.\\nInstruction: Carefully read the question and the provided context.

An observational study is carried out with hypertensive patients recruited from two village-based community health centres in Catalonia (Spain) serving an area with a total population of 2800 inhabitants. All patients treated for hypertension visiting the health centre on a specific day of the week and during the same timetable between October 2000 and May 2001 were included. The difference between physician-systolic BP and nurse-systolic BP was 5.16 mmHg (95% CI 2.62-7.7; p<0.001). The difference between physician-systolic BP and self-measured systolic BP was 4.67 mmHg (95% CI 0.89-8.44; p=0.016). The differences between nurse-systolic BP and self-measured systolic BP were not significant (0.49 mmHg; 95% CI 3.71-2.71; p=0.758). With regards to diastolic BP, no significant differences were found between the different ways of measurement. NBP gave the following values: sensitivity (Sn) of 92% and specificity (Sp) of 60%; positive predictive value (PPV) of 65.7% and negative predictive value (NPV) of 90% with a positive coefficient of probability (CP+) of 2.3 and a negative coefficient of probability (CP-) of 0.133.

This may be due to the influence of ovarian stimulation on the chromosomal constitution of the embryos which could be translated into localized chromosomal anomalies in the placenta. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of confined placental mosaicism (CPM) in IVF\/ICSI pregnancies and spontaneous conceptions. We conducted a multi-centre retrospective analysis of karyotype results obtained by chorionic villus sampling (CVS), performed due to advanced maternal age (>or=36 years at 18 weeks of gestation), in the Netherlands between 1995 and 2005. From a total of 322 246 pregnancies, 20 885 CVS results were analysed: 235 in the IVF\/ICSI group and 20 650 in the control group. The mean age of women in both groups was 38.4 years (mean difference -0.08, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.18). Data relating to the fetal karyotype were missing in 143 cases in the control group. When taking into account missing data, the incidence of CPM was lower in the IVF-ICSI group than in the control group, 1.3% versus 2.2% (odds ratio 0.59, 95% CI 0.19-1.85), whereas the incidence of fetal chromosomal anomalies was increased 4.3% versus 2.4% (odds ratio 1.81, 95% CI 0.95-3.42).
