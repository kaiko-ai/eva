# - Skipping B101: doesn't like 'assert' to check for condition.
#   Reasoning: we do not perform code optimisation and thus this should not apply.
#   See https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.5/plugins/b101_assert_used.html
# - Skipping B404: doesn't like 'subprocess' module.
#   We use it to run shell commands. We should emphasize to developpers its weakness.
#   See https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.5/blacklists/blacklist_imports.html#b404-import-subprocess
# - Skipping B113: request_without_timeout
#   This rule adds a lot of noise to the results, is not a security issue and not something we want to improve upon ATM.
