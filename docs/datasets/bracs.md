# BRACS


The BReAst Carcinoma Subtyping (BRACS) is a new dataset of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
histopathological images of breast carcinoma.

Images (WSI) of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained breast tissues were generated by using an
Aperio AT2 scanner at 0.25 µm/pixel for 40× resolution. Some Regions of Interest (RoIs) are
associated with a subset of WSIs. See example figure below. Both WSIs and RoIs were annotated
according to the seven classes mentioned above (N, PB, UDH, FEA, ADH, DCIS, IC), by three expert
pathologists of the Complex Structure Pathological Anatomy and Cytopathology of National Cancer
Institute – IRCCS Fondazione Pascale, Naples, Italy.

While the BRACS contains 547 WSIs collected by 189 patients, the `BRACS_ROI` subset which
we use in this benchmarks contains 4539 extracted ROIs / patches.

### Splits

The data source provides train/validation/test splits

| Splits | Train         | Validation    | Test         |
|----------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| #Samples | 3657 (80.57%) | 312 (6.87%) | 570 (12.56%) |


### Organization

The BRACS data is organized as follows:

```
BRACS_RoI
├── train
│   ├── 0_N                    # 1 folder per class 
│   ├── 1_PB
│   ├── ...
├── val
│   ├── 0_N
│   ├── ...
├── test
│   ├── 0_N
│   ├── ...
```


## Download and preprocessing
The `BRACS` dataset class doesn't download the data during runtime and must be downloaded manually from [the official source](https://www.bracs.icar.cnr.it/download/).
